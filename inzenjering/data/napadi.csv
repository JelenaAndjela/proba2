#Name,Likelihood Of Attack,Typical Severity,Skills Required,Prerequisites,Mitigations
Parameter Injection;Medium;Medium; ;::The target application must use a parameter encoding where separators and parameter identifiers are expressed in regular text.;Attack
Argument Injection;High;High;Medium;Target software fails to strip all user-supplied input of any content that could cause the shell to perform unexpected actions.;Design: Do not program input values directly on command shell, instead treat user input as guilty until proven innocent. Build a function that takes user input and converts it to applications specific types and values, stripping or filtering out all unauthorized commands and characters in the process.
Command Delimiters;High;High;Medium;Software's input validation or filtering must not detect and block presence of additional malicious command.;Design: Perform allowlist validation against a positive specification for command length, type, and parameters.
Format String Injection;High;High;High;The target application must accept a strings as user input, fail to sanitize string formatting characters in the user input, and process this string using functions that interpret string formatting characters.;Limit the usage of formatting string functions.
Reflection Injection;;Very High;;The target application must utilize reflection libraries and allow users to directly control the parameters to these methods.;Attack
Flash Injection;High;Medium;Medium;The target must be capable of running Flash applications.;Attack

Pharming;High;Very High;Medium;Vulnerable DNS software or improperly protected hosts file or router that can be poisoned;All sensitive information must be handled over a secure connection.
Phishing;High;Very High;Medium;An attacker needs to have a way to initiate contact with the victim.;Do not follow any links that you receive within your e-mails and certainly do not input any login credentials on the page that they take you too.
Spear Phishing;High;High;Medium;None. Any user can be targeted by a Spear Phishing attack.;Do not follow any links that you receive within your e-mails and certainly do not input any login credentials on the page that they take you too.
Mobile Phishing;High;High;Medium;An adversary needs mobile phone numbers to initiate contact with the victim.;Do not follow any links that you receive within text messages and do not input any login credentials on the page that they take you too.
Voice Phishing;High;High;Medium;An adversary needs phone numbers to initiate contact with the victim, in addition to a legitimate-looking telephone number to call the victim from.;Do not accept calls from unknown numbers or from numbers that may be flagged as spam.
Fake the Source of Data;;Medium;;This attack is only applicable when a vulnerable entity associates data or services with an identity. ;Attack
DNS Rebinding;High;Very High;Medium;The target browser must access content server from the adversary controlled DNS name.;Design: IP Pinning causes browsers to record the IP address to which a given name resolves and continue using this address regardless of the TTL set in the DNS response.
Counterfeit Websites;;High;;None;Attack
Counterfeit Organizations;;High;;None;Attack
DNS Spoofing;;;Low;On/In Path Device;Design: Avoid dependence on DNS::Design: Include hosts file/IP address in the application
Token Impersonation;;Medium;;This pattern of attack is only applicable when a downstream user leverages tokens to verify identity, and then takes action based on that identity.;Attack
Principal Spoof;;Medium;;The target must associate data or activities with a person's identity and the adversary must be able to modify this identity without detection.;Attack
Cross Frame Scripting (XFS);;High;;The user's browser must have vulnerabilities in its implementation of the same-origin policy. ;Avoid clicking on untrusted links.
Terrestrial Jamming;Low;High;;;Attack
Signature Spoof;;;High;The victim or victim system is dependent upon a cryptographic signature-based verification system for validation of one or more security events or actions.;Attack
Resource Location Spoofing;Medium;Medium;;None. All applications rely on file paths and therefore, in theory, they or their resources could be affected by this type of attack.;Monitor network activity to detect any anomalous or unauthorized communication exchanges.::
Redirect Access to Libraries;High;Very High;Low;::The target must utilize external libraries and must fail to verify the integrity of these libraries before using them.::;::Implementation: Restrict the permission to modify the entries in the configuration file.::Implementation: Check the integrity of the dynamically linked libraries before use them.
Establish Rogue Location;Medium;Medium;Low;::A resource is expected to available to the user.::;Attack
Action Spoofing;High;Very High;;::The adversary must convince the victim into performing the decoy action.::The adversary must have the means to control a user's interface to present them with a decoy action as well as the actual malicious action. Simple versions of this attack can be performed using web pages requiring only that the adversary be able to host (or control) content that the user visits.::;::Avoid interacting with suspicious sites or clicking suspicious links.::An organization should provide regular, robust cybersecurity training to its employees.::
Clickjacking;Medium;High;High;::The victim is communicating with the target application via a web based UI and not a thick client::The victim's browser security policies allow at least one of the following JavaScript, Flash, iFrames, ActiveX, or CSS.::The victim uses a modern browser that supports UI elements like clickable buttons (i.e. not using an old text only browser)::The victim has an active session with the target system.::The target system's interaction window is open in the victim's browser and supports the ability for initiating sensitive actions on behalf of the user in the target system::;::If using the Firefox browser, use the NoScript plug-in that will help forbid iFrames.::Turn off JavaScript, Flash and disable CSS.::When maintaining an authenticated session with a privileged target system, do not use the same browser to navigate to unfamiliar sites to perform other activities. Finish working with the target system and logout first before proceeding to other tasks.::
Android Activity Hijack;;Medium;High;::The adversary must have previously installed the malicious application onto the Android device that will run in place of the trusted activity.::;::To mitigate this type of an attack, explicit intents should be used whenever sensitive data is being sent. An 'explicit intent' is delivered to a specific application as declared within the intent, whereas an 'implicit intent' is directed to an application as defined by the Android operating system. If an implicit intent must be used, then it should be assumed that the intent will be received by an unknown application and any response should be treated accordingly (i.e., with appropriate security controls).::Never use implicit intents for inter-application communication.::
Task Impersonation;Medium;High;Low;::The adversary must already have access to the target system via some means.::A legitimate task must exist that an adversary can impersonate to glean credentials.::The user's privileges allow them to execute certain tasks with elevated privileges.::;::The only known mitigation to this attack is to avoid installing the malicious application on the device. However, to impersonate a running task the malicious application does need the GET_TASKS permission to be able to query the task list, and being suspicious of applications with that permission can help.::
Tapjacking;Low;Low;;::This pattern of attack requires the ability to execute a malicious application on the user's device. This malicious application is used to present the interface to the user and make the attack possible.::;Attack
Software Integrity Attack;;Low;Medium;;Attack
Malicious Software Download;;Very High;;;Attack
Malicious Software Update;;High;High;;::Validate software updates before installing.
Manipulate Human Behavior;Medium;Medium;;The adversary must have the means and knowledge of how to communicate with the target in some manner.::;::An organization should provide regular, robust cybersecurity training to its employees to prevent successful social engineering attacks.::
