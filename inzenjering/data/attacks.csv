Name,Likelihood Of Attack,Typical Severity,Skills Required,Prerequisites,Mitigations
Parameter Injection,Medium,Medium,,  The target application must use a parameter encoding where separators and parameter identifiers are expressed in regular text.  The target application must accept a string as user input, fail to sanitize characters that have a special meaning in the parameter encoding, and insert the user-supplied string in an encoding which is then processed.  ,  Implement an audit log written to a separate host. In the event of a compromise, the audit log may be able to provide evidence and details of the compromise.  Treat all user input as untrusted data that must be validated before use.
Argument Injection,High,High, Medium  ,  Target software fails to strip all user-supplied input of any content that could cause the shell to perform unexpected actions.  Software must allow for unvalidated or unfiltered input to be executed on operating system shell, and, optionally, the system configuration must allow for output to be sent back to client.  ,  Design  Do not program input values directly on command shell, instead treat user input as guilty until proven innocent. Build a function that takes user input and converts it to applications specific types and values, stripping or filtering out all unauthorized commands and characters in the process.  Design  Limit program privileges, so if metacharacters or other methods circumvent program input validation routines and shell access is attained then it is not running under a privileged account. chroot jails create a sandbox for the application to execute in, making it more difficult for an attacker to elevate privilege even in the case that a compromise has occurred.  Implementation  Implement an audit log that is written to a separate host, in the event of a compromise the audit log may be able to provide evidence and details of the compromise.
Command Delimiters,High,High, Medium  ,  Software's input validation or filtering must not detect and block presence of additional malicious command.  ,  Design  Perform allowlist validation against a positive specification for command length, type, and parameters.  Design  Limit program privileges, so if commands circumvent program input validation or filter routines then commands do not running under a privileged account  Implementation  Perform input validation for all remote content.  Implementation  Use type conversions such as JDBC prepared statements.
Format String Injection,High,High, High  ,  The target application must accept a strings as user input, fail to sanitize string formatting characters in the user input, and process this string using functions that interpret string formatting characters.  ,  Limit the usage of formatting string functions.  Strong input validation - All user-controllable input must be validated and filtered for illegal formatting characters.
Reflection Injection,,Very High,,  The target application must utilize reflection libraries and allow users to directly control the parameters to these methods. If the adversary can host classes where the target can invoke them, more powerful variants of this attack are possible.  The target application must accept a string as user input, fail to sanitize characters that have a special meaning in the parameter encoding, and insert the user-supplied string in an encoding which is then processed.  ,
Flash Injection,High,Medium,  Medium,  The target must be capable of running Flash applications. In some cases, the victim must follow an attacker-supplied link.  ,  Implementation  remove sensitive information such as user name and password in the SWF file.  Implementation  use validation on both client and server side.  Implementation  remove debug information.  Implementation  use SSL when loading external data  Implementation  use crossdomain.xml file to allow the application domain to load stuff or the SWF file called by other domain.
Information Elicitation,,Low,,,
Identity Spoofing,Medium,Medium,,  The identity associated with the message or resource must be removable or modifiable in an undetectable way.  ,  Employ robust authentication processes (e.g., multi-factor authentication).  
Pharming,High,Very High, Medium  ,  Vulnerable DNS software or improperly protected hosts file or router that can be poisoned  A website that handles sensitive information but does not use a secure connection and a certificate that is valid is also prone to pharming  ,  All sensitive information must be handled over a secure connection.  Known vulnerabilities in DNS or router software or in operating systems must be patched as soon as a fix has been released and tested.  End users must ensure that they provide sensitive information only to websites that they trust, over a secure connection with a valid certificate issued by a well-known certificate authority.
Phishing,High,Very High, Medium  ,  An attacker needs to have a way to initiate contact with the victim. Typically that will happen through e-mail.  An attacker needs to correctly guess the entity with which the victim does business and impersonate it. Most of the time phishers just use the most popular banks/services and send out their hooks to many potential victims.  An attacker needs to have a sufficiently compelling call to action to prompt the user to take action.  The replicated website needs to look extremely similar to the original website and the URL used to get to that website needs to look like the real URL of the said business entity.  ,  Do not follow any links that you receive within your e-mails and certainly do not input any login credentials on the page that they take you too. Instead, call your Bank, PayPal, eBay, etc., and inquire about the problem. A safe practice would also be to type the URL of your bank in the browser directly and only then log in. Also, never reply to any e-mails that ask you to provide sensitive information of any kind.
Spear Phishing,High,High, Medium  ,  None. Any user can be targeted by a Spear Phishing attack.  ,  Do not follow any links that you receive within your e-mails and certainly do not input any login credentials on the page that they take you too. Instead, call your Bank, PayPal, eBay, etc., and inquire about the problem. A safe practice would also be to type the URL of your bank in the browser directly and only then log in. Also, never reply to any e-mails that ask you to provide sensitive information of any kind.
Mobile Phishing,High,High, Medium  ,  An adversary needs mobile phone numbers to initiate contact with the victim.  An adversary needs to correctly guess the entity with which the victim does business and impersonate it. Most of the time phishers just use the most popular banks/services and send out their hooks to many potential victims.  An adversary needs to have a sufficiently compelling call to action to prompt the user to take action.  The replicated website needs to look extremely similar to the original website and the URL used to get to that website needs to look like the real URL of the said business entity.  ,  Do not follow any links that you receive within text messages and do not input any login credentials on the page that they take you too. Instead, call your Bank, PayPal, eBay, etc., and inquire about the problem. Safe practices also include leveraging the entity's mobile application or directly typing the entity's URL in the browser and only then logging in. Never reply to any text messages that ask you to provide sensitive information of any kind.
Voice Phishing,High,High,  Medium  ,  An adversary needs phone numbers to initiate contact with the victim, in addition to a legitimate-looking telephone number to call the victim from.  An adversary needs to correctly guess the entity with which the victim does business and impersonate it. Most of the time phishers just use the most popular banks/services and send out their hooks to many potential victims.  An adversary needs to have a sufficiently compelling call to action to prompt the user to take action.  If passively conducting this attack via a spoofed website, replicated website needs to look extremely similar to the original website and the URL used to get to that website needs to look like the real URL of the said business entity.  ,  Do not accept calls from unknown numbers or from numbers that may be flagged as spam. Also, do not call numbers that appear on-screen after being unexpectedly redirected to potentially malicious websites. In either case, do not provide sensitive information over voice calls that are not legitimately initiated. Instead, call your Bank, PayPal, eBay, etc., via the number on their public-facing website and inquire about the problem.
Fake the Source of Data,,Medium,,  This attack is only applicable when a vulnerable entity associates data or services with an identity. Without such an association, there would be no reason to fake the source.  ,
DNS Rebinding,High,Very High, Medium  ,  The target browser must access content server from the adversary controlled DNS name. Web advertisements are often used for this purpose. The target browser must honor the TTL value returned by the adversary and re-resolve the adversary's DNS name after initial contact.  ,  Design  IP Pinning causes browsers to record the IP address to which a given name resolves and continue using this address regardless of the TTL set in the DNS response. Unfortunately, this is incompatible with the design of some legitimate sites.  Implementation  Reject HTTP request with a malicious Host header.  Implementation  Employ DNS resolvers that prevent external names from resolving to internal addresses.
Counterfeit Websites,,High,,  None  ,
Counterfeit Organizations,,High,,  None  ,
DNS Spoofing,,, Low ,  On/In Path Device  ,  Design  Avoid dependence on DNS  Design  Include hosts file/IP address in the application  Implementation  Utilize a .onion domain with Tor support  Implementation  DNSSEC  Implementation  DNS-hold-open
Token Impersonation,,Medium,,  This pattern of attack is only applicable when a downstream user leverages tokens to verify identity, and then takes action based on that identity.  ,
Principal Spoof,,Medium,,  The target must associate data or activities with a person's identity and the adversary must be able to modify this identity without detection.  ,
Cross Frame Scripting (XFS),,High,,  The user's browser must have vulnerabilities in its implementation of the same-origin policy. It allows certain data in a loaded page to originate from different servers/domains.  ,  Avoid clicking on untrusted links.  Employ techniques such as frame busting, which is a method by which developers aim to prevent their site being loaded within a frame.  
Terrestrial Jamming,Low,High,,,
Signature Spoof,,,  High,  The victim or victim system is dependent upon a cryptographic signature-based verification system for validation of one or more security events or actions.  The validation can be bypassed via an attacker-provided signature that makes it appear that the legitimate authoritative or reputable source provided the signature.  ,
Resource Location Spoofing,Medium,Medium,,  None. All applications rely on file paths and therefore, in theory, they or their resources could be affected by this type of attack.  ,  Monitor network activity to detect any anomalous or unauthorized communication exchanges.  
Redirect Access to Libraries,High,Very High, Low,  The target must utilize external libraries and must fail to verify the integrity of these libraries before using them.  ,  Implementation  Restrict the permission to modify the entries in the configuration file.  Implementation  Check the integrity of the dynamically linked libraries before use them.  Implementation  Use obfuscation and other techniques to prevent reverse engineering the libraries.
Establish Rogue Location,Medium,Medium, Low  ,  A resource is expected to available to the user.  ,
Action Spoofing,High,Very High,,  The adversary must convince the victim into performing the decoy action.  The adversary must have the means to control a user's interface to present them with a decoy action as well as the actual malicious action. Simple versions of this attack can be performed using web pages requiring only that the adversary be able to host (or control) content that the user visits.  ,  Avoid interacting with suspicious sites or clicking suspicious links.  An organization should provide regular, robust cybersecurity training to its employees.  
Clickjacking,Medium,High, High  ,  The victim is communicating with the target application via a web based UI and not a thick client  The victim's browser security policies allow at least one of the following JavaScript, Flash, iFrames, ActiveX, or CSS.  The victim uses a modern browser that supports UI elements like clickable buttons (i.e. not using an old text only browser)  The victim has an active session with the target system.  The target system's interaction window is open in the victim's browser and supports the ability for initiating sensitive actions on behalf of the user in the target system  ,  If using the Firefox browser, use the NoScript plug-in that will help forbid iFrames.  Turn off JavaScript, Flash and disable CSS.  When maintaining an authenticated session with a privileged target system, do not use the same browser to navigate to unfamiliar sites to perform other activities. Finish working with the target system and logout first before proceeding to other tasks.
Android Activity Hijack,,Medium, High  ,  The adversary must have previously installed the malicious application onto the Android device that will run in place of the trusted activity.  ,  To mitigate this type of an attack, explicit intents should be used whenever sensitive data is being sent. An 'explicit intent' is delivered to a specific application as declared within the intent, whereas an 'implicit intent' is directed to an application as defined by the Android operating system. If an implicit intent must be used, then it should be assumed that the intent will be received by an unknown application and any response should be treated accordingly (i.e., with appropriate security controls).  Never use implicit intents for inter-application communication.
Task Impersonation,Medium,High,  Low  ,  The adversary must already have access to the target system via some means.  A legitimate task must exist that an adversary can impersonate to glean credentials.  The user's privileges allow them to execute certain tasks with elevated privileges.  ,  The only known mitigation to this attack is to avoid installing the malicious application on the device. However, to impersonate a running task the malicious application does need the GET_TASKS permission to be able to query the task list, and being suspicious of applications with that permission can help.
Tapjacking,Low,Low,,  This pattern of attack requires the ability to execute a malicious application on the user's device. This malicious application is used to present the interface to the user and make the attack possible.  ,
